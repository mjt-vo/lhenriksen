## Among the Living Dead: Desire in _Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me_ and _Get Out_

There is a kind of desire that moves to consume, to control, to incorporate, to exterminate, and erase. This kind of desire is nothing like the desire for justice Avery Gordon describes, this kind of desire and way of desiring will never make anyone free. To be the object of this desire, to be caught in its cage, is to have the fullness of your life and living suspended. It may very well be the death of you. The characters in David Lynch’s 1992 _Fire Walk With Me,_ the prequel to his massively popular television show, _Twin Peaks,_ and in Jordan Peele’s 2017 enormously successful and Oscar-winning horror debut, _Get Out,_ are caught in such a trap, the objects of such oppressive desires, forced into a state between life and death, neither fully present nor absent, living ghosts, socially dead.
