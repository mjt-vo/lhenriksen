<p>There is a kind of desire that moves to consume, to control, to incorporate, to exterminate, and erase. This kind of desire is nothing like the desire for justice Avery Gordon describes, this kind of desire and way of desiring will never make anyone free. To be the object of this desire, to be caught in its cage, is to have the fullness of your life and living suspended. It may very well be the death of you. The characters in David Lynch’s 1992 <em>Fire Walk With Me,</em> the prequel to his massively popular television show, <em>Twin Peaks,</em> and in Jordan Peele’s 2017 enormously successful and Oscar-winning horror debut, <em>Get Out,</em> are caught in such a trap, the objects of such oppressive desires, forced into a state between life and death, neither fully present nor absent, living ghosts, socially dead.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
